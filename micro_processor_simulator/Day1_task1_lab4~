; Lab 4: Compute 2's Complement of an 8-bit Number
; Input : [8000H]
; Output: [8001H] = 2's complement of [8000H]

        LDA 8000H     ; Load number from 8000H into A
        CMA           ; Take 1's complement of A
        ADI 01H       ; Add 1 to get 2's complement
        STA 8001H     ; Store result at 8001H
        HLT           ; Stop execution
