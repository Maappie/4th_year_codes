1. Relay Module
Control Side
VCC -> 5V of arduino (or any power source)
GND -> GND of arduino (or any power source)
Input -> D5 of arduino

Load Side
NO -> postive side of LED (add series resistor)
COM -> 3.3V or 5V(make sure to add resistor to avoid burning LED)

2. LED
remaining negative side of LED
Negative side of LED -> GND of arduino (or any power source)

3. Button 
One side of button -> D2 of arduino
Other side -> GND
